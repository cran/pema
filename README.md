Conduct *pe*nalized *m*eta-*a*nalysis (*“pema”*) In meta-analysis, there
are often between-study differences. These can be coded as moderator
variables, and controlled for using meta-regression. However, if the
number of moderators is large relative to the number of studies, such an
analysis may be overfitted. Penalized meta-regression is useful in these
cases, because it shrinks the regression slopes of irrelevant moderators
towards zero.

## Where do I start?

For most users, the recommended starting point is to [read the
paper](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6phs5) published in **Research
Synthesis Methods**, which introduces the method, validates it, and
provides a tutorial example.

## Installing the package

Use [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pema) to install the
latest release of `pema`:

    install.packages("pema")

Alternatively, use [R-universe](https://cjvanlissa.r-universe.dev) to
install the development version of `pema` by running the following code:

``` r
options(repos = c(
    cjvanlissa = 'https://cjvanlissa.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

install.packages('pema')
```
